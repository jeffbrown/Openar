### About Openar

Openar is a Swing-based, interactive Clojure environment written in Clojure.

In Openar you can run application called *oplix*. Openar comes with bunch
of oplixes, such as *REPL*, Clojure editor *Ced*, and Incanter front-end
*Incantea*. With help of these oplixes and powerful Clojure libraries you can
learn and study Clojure, try out your ideas and run your projects, and even
develop your own oplixes, all in Clojure interactively.

Please read the [Openar Users Manual](doc/Manuals/Openar_Users_Manual/out/Table_of_Conents.html)
for more details.

### Current Status

This version of Openar is an early experimental, proof-of-concept version.
Lots of features that are supposed to be in this kind of system are missing;
menus, functions and oplixes for file system and project management,
customization and refactoring tools, oplix UI design and development
facilities, etc. Small part is still written in Java.
